#About Pickup PG

Hello!

We created Pickup PG as a way to connect residents of Prince George's County to clean-up efforts around the community. As a group, we saw an opportunity to optimize the current Prince George's County trash collection volunteer system, with an all-in-one site that provides users with both opportunities to easily view current and future clean-ups as well as connect with community clean-up sponsors. 

We reccomend using either Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox as this is what we optimized our website for.
