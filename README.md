Welcome to Pickup PG, the all in one solution to connecting residents of Prince Georgeâ€™s County to organized community clean-up efforts. 

In order to get started with operating out website, first clone our files from our GitHub page at *Insert Link. Additionally, you should be sure to check that our dataset API is still being supported and is available at https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Environment/LitterTRAK/9tsa-iner. 

Known Bugs:
-Leaflet map on "Where we Clean" will sometimes be slow to load and time out the page. 
-Images in index.html and about.html will sometimes not load onto the page when the site is run on Heroku. 

Future Development:

Further development for our website would be to continue to improve the CSS and overall cleanliness of our page. Additionally, our dataset contains data on cleanups that have mostly happened in the past. Ideally with more time we would like to reach out to the organizations already partnered with PG County to gain access to information on their future efforts. With time, we would like to increase the scalability of our website so that if we want to pitch our platform to other counties in Maryland, the transition would be as simple as inserting a dataset for that county.
