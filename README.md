INST 377 Final Group Project: Trash Collection in PG County

#Description of Project#

Our project is dedicated to introduce an interactive website to assist in helping decrease the carbon footprint in Prince George's County.

Littering costs Americans over $11 billion annually and wreaks havoc on streets, forests, and the environment globally. In PG County alone, thousands of clean up efforts go unnoticed due to a lack of a proper network and central hub for sharing data relevant to this cause.

Our aim is to introduce an interactive website to be able to: offer visibility to the local community as to where clean-ups are occurring, aid with transparency, informing the community of who is conducting these clean-ups, and how one can get involved
