     <!--<h2>How Can You Get Involved with this Site?</h2>
      <p>Our site takes data from the Prince George's County website about organizations trash collection volunteering and allows a user to be able to look at a map and see past clean-ups and where they occurred on the page "Where We Clean". These points can be filtered by year. Each data point also shows the organization that hosted the volunteer clean-up and what kind of environmental cleaning was done, be it garbage pickup or planting trees. These organizations are shown when you hover over those points and clicking a map point you want lets you see the specific location on the side of the map in the middle of the page under "Location and Times".
	</p>
      <p>If you want to be involved, check out the "Get Involved" Page. Here 6 active organizations in the Prince George's Community are listed with their logos. Clicking on the names of the organizations takes you to their about pages and clicking on the number listed will call that organization.
	</p>
      <p>These aspects have made it easy to connect with volunteer opportunities that you may want to be involved in as well as connecting with those organizations. By having a map that shows locations and the organizations there, you will be able to see clean-up organizations and what kinds of cleaning is happening close to you in Prince George's County. Our site allows you to be able to research those organizations and contact them with ease so that you may get involved.
