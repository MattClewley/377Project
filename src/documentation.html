     <h2>Our Website Pages</h2>
      <p> Each page contains a navigation bar at the top so that you can effortlessly switch between pages on our site. If you ever want to navigate back to our home page just click either the 'Home' link or feel free to click on our logo in the top right corner. Our Home page displays a short sentence about each page and a link to each one so that you can navigate to the page you wish to visit. The Get Involved page is where you can find contact information for each organization that is involved in cleanup efforts in PG County. Feel free to visit the link to their website or give them a call to get in contact with them. The About Us page features information about us, PG Pickup, and how you can get involved with us.  
	</p>
      <p>The Where We Clean page features a helpful map with several filters for you to narrow down your search. The map displays each cleanup effort that has taken place and will continue to display new efforts after they occur. This page is helpful for you to see where cleanup efforts are occuring around you and what organization is doing them, that way you can contact them if you want. You can select the 'Fiscal Year' filter, 'District' filter, or both and the map will be populated with the cleanup effort location points. If you are confused about what district you are in click the button labelled 'What District Am I In?' which will take you to the PG County website page for Councilmanic Districts so you can find out.
