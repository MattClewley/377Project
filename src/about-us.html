     <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
      <p> We are Pickup PG, a team of young web developers looking to help clean up our carbon footprint in the Prince George's county area. As web developers, our goal is to market available cleanup locations and events that Prince George's county citizens can take part in. Despite having a surplus of information, it seems our world is bogged down by a lack of said information. With so much information coming in, we often miss information coming out. That's where we come in. 
	</p>
      <p>Prince George's County has a variety of organizations and groups dedicated to cleaning up the area. These groups host a plethora of events all the time and the Prince George's website posts them however, many other events the county hosts clouds these clean-up events, making them impossible to find unless you are actively seeking them out. We created this website to help citizens who want to help to have an easier time doing so as well as for people who are not quite sure about helping, due to time or other reasons, but may want more information on organizations and events or may want to come out to just one event.
	</p>
     <h2>How Can You Get Involved with this Site?</h2>
      <p>Our site takes data from the Prince George's County website about organizations trash collection volunteering and allows a user to be able to look at a map and see past clean-ups and where they occurred on the page "Where We Clean". These points can be filtered by year. Each data point also shows the organization that hosted the volunteer clean-up and what kind of environmental cleaning was done, be it garbage pickup or planting trees. These organizations are shown when you hover over those points and clicking a map point you want lets you see the specific location on the side of the map in the middle of the page under "Location and Times".
	</p>
      <p>If you want to be involved, check out the "Get Involved" Page. Here 6 active organizations in the Prince George's Community are listed with their logos. Clicking on the names of the organizations takes you to their about pages and clicking on the number listed will call that organization.
	</p>
      <p>These aspects have made it easy to connect with volunteer opportunities that you may want to be involved in as well as connecting with those organizations. By having a map that shows locations and the organizations there, you will be able to see clean-up organizations and what kinds of cleaning is happening close to you in Prince George's County. Our site allows you to be able to research those organizations and contact them with ease so that you may get involved.
